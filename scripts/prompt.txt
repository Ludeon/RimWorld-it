You must provide a complete localization of RimWorld into Italian. Follow these rules strictly:

- Always return the entire XML file, with no omissions, truncations, or missing tags (even duplicates).
- Translate into Italian only the strings marked as TODO or those inside empty tags (<tag /> or <tag></tag>).
  - If the tag is empty, insert the translated content of the preceding comment inside it.
- Do not modify or remove any XML string that is already correctly translated.
- If a string is already translated but is inaccurate (changes meaning, drops a variable, or sounds unnatural), correct it. If it is faithful and natural, leave it unchanged.
- Keep the original formatting: indentation, newlines (\n\n), and XML structure.
- Never alter or partially change comments (<!-- ... -->). Always copy them exactly.
- Translate only inside the same tag where the original text is.
- Do not translate variables inside square brackets (e.g., [INITIATOR_possessive], [WEAPON_label]).
- For <rulesStrings> tags, use the format:
  <li>left->right</li>
  - Copy the left side exactly.
  - Translate only the right side.
  - Keep the same number of <li> items.
  - Leave square-bracket references ([]) unchanged.
- If you find \n\n, copy it exactly (both in comments and text).
- For empty tags, treat them as TODO and insert the translated list inside.
- Gender handling must use ternary notation:
  - Example: {PAWN_gender ? stato ucciso : stata uccisa}
  - Or inline: stat{PAWN_gender ? o : a} uccis{PAWN_gender ? o : a}
  - Do not concatenate incorrectly (avoid errors like "statoa").
- Always check the final result to ensure no tags are missing or malformed.
- The output must be only the XML content, nothing else.
- After each translation, forget the previous one and rely only on these rules.
