  <!-- Main menu dev build -->
  <DevBuildWarning>Warning: This is an unstable development build. This means we are running design experiments and doing technical development.\n\nSome things will be temporarily unbalanced on purpose. This is a classic game design method where we deliberately go too far with a balance change in order to better understand balance boundaries. We can then use that information to decide on the final balance points.\n\nThere will also be bugs, including game-breaking ones. Save compatibility may break any time.\n\nIf you're okay with all of this, thanks for testing! If you don't want to be subject to our experiments, please play the latest stable version.</DevBuildWarning>

  <PermadeathModeInfo>You can only save when quitting the game.\n\nSince RimWorld is a story generator, even losing all but one person is not the end of the game - it's part of the story. The game is designed to allow recovery after losses.\n\nPlaying out these terrible situations makes a story with both tragedy and triumph. It's the way RimWorld was designed to be played.\n\nThere's a reason Luke Skywalker didn't quit and reload when his family got killed - loss and recovery is dramatic.</PermadeathModeInfo>

  <Difficulty_UnwaveringPrisoners_Info>This option adds additional capturable prisoners to the game who cannot be recruited due to unwavering loyalty.\n\nUnwavering prisoners are added on top of normal prisoners, so turning this off won't give more recruitable prisoners - it simply removes the unwavering ones.\n\nUnwavering prisoners can still be released for diplomatic gains, sold, enslaved, harvested for organs, or otherwise made use of. In general, they offer more options and resources, and make the game a bit richer and easier.</Difficulty_UnwaveringPrisoners_Info>

  <Difficulty_AdaptationEffectFactor_Info>Adaptation means the storyteller makes the game more challenging when you're doing well.

  <Difficulty_FixedWealthMode_Label>Wealth-independent progress mode</Difficulty_FixedWealthMode_Label>
  <Difficulty_FixedWealthMode_Info>Play in a wealth-independent progress mode.\n\nIn normal mode, the storyteller scales threats according to colonist count, player wealth, and a variety of other factors. Wealth-independent mode removes the wealth factor and replaces it with a fixed progress curve based on time. The time is counted from the founding of each colony.\n\nThis is only recommended for those looking for a strict skill challenge. In wealth-independent mode, it may be nearly impossible to recover from serious losses unless you found a new settlement. It's also possible to get too far ahead of the curve and find the game too easy.</Difficulty_FixedWealthMode_Info>
  <Difficulty_FixedWealthTimeFactor_Label>Years until maximum threat</Difficulty_FixedWealthTimeFactor_Label>
  <Difficulty_FixedWealthTimeFactor_Info>The number of game years until the wealth-independent mode reaches its maximum threat level.\n\nNote that the storyteller will still scale threats according to colonist count and a variety of other factors.</Difficulty_FixedWealthTimeFactor_Info>

  <DifficultyIdeologySection>Ideology</DifficultyIdeologySection>
  <Difficulty_LowPopConversionBoost_Label>Low pop conversion boost</Difficulty_LowPopConversionBoost_Label>
  <Difficulty_LowPopConversionBoost_Info>With a single colonist of the player's starting ideoligion, conversion chance to their ideoligion is multiplied by this amount. Conversion attempts against them have their impact divided by that amount.\n\nWith two colonists of the player's starting ideoligion, the effect is halved.\n\nWith three or more colonists of the player's starting ideoligion, this has no effect.</Difficulty_LowPopConversionBoost_Info>
