    <li>questDescription->[faction_name] is ready to grant [pawn_definite] the title of [newTitle] and the power of a level [psylinkLevel] psylink in a bestowing ceremony.\n\nThe bestower will arrive by shuttle and perform the ceremony.\n\nThe bestower will only give a title if any throneroom requirements are satisfied. There's a chance of gaining extra honor, depending on how many viewers attend the ceremony. Additionally, every viewer gains a mood bonus.\n\nYou can betray the bestower to steal psylink neuroformers, but this will make [faction_name] your enemy.\n\nIf you miss or fail this ceremony, there will be another opportunity later. If the bestower or guards are harmed for any reason, there will be diplomatic consequences.</li>
