  <!-- EN: The seed of an archean tree. It can be planted to grow an archean tree, which converts nearby terrain into rich soil.\n\nArchean trees were bioengineered to terraform deadworlds and early-stage rimworlds. They are hardy enough to survive in the vacuum of space and produce a small amount of oxygen. The tree's delicate roots prevent it from being replanted. -->

  <!-- EN: A tree bioengineered to terraform deadworlds and early-stage rimworlds. The tree hosts a special microbial community in its roots which enriches nearby terrain into rich soil. The trees are hardy enough to survive in the vacuum of space and produce a small amount of oxygen.\n\nArchean trees are sterile, preventing them from becoming an invasive species after terraforming has been completed. They can only be grown from seeds produced on glitterworld planets. The tree's delicate root system prevents it from being replanted. -->
