  <!-- EN: The fruiting body of a hallucinogenic fungus. When eaten it produces vivid sensory experiences and lifts mood. There is a small chance to immediately induce a catatonic state, or creatively inspire the user. Psilocaps are not addictive, but can cause overdoses if eaten in large quantities.\n\nSome cultures use psilocaps for religious ceremonies, while many others have outlawed the mushrooms entirely. -->
