  <!-- EN: A gravtech unit that allows grav engine lift to coordinate more efficiently with traditional thrusters. It reduces the fuel needed for gravship flight.\n\nA gravship can support two fuel optimizers. -->

  <!-- EN: grav anchor -->
  <GravAnchor.label>TODO</GravAnchor.label>
  <!-- EN: Prevents the local map from being destroyed during a gravship launch.\n\nGrav anchors passively reduce unstable gravitation shear in a large area, which prevents the damaging effects of a gravship launch. It can't be constructed on the gravship itself because it would prevent flight entirely. -->

  <!-- EN: grav engine -->
  <GravEngine.label>TODO</GravEngine.label>
  <!-- EN: The ultratech heart of a gravship. The grav engine generates lift by inverting and intensifying the effect of gravity in a field around itself. This engine can lift upwards, but does not produce forward thrust. It can't function far from a large gravity well like a planet, so it is useless for interplanetary travel.\n\nWhen launched, anything on substructure that's connected to the grav engine will be transported to a new map. Without a grav anchor, launching a gravship will abandon your current map.\n\nGlitterworld engineers use gravships to launch orbital platforms and build skyrippers. They require massive and hyper-specialized facilities to produce, making them a rare sight outside of glitterworlds. -->

It works against normal shots and mortars. Those inside can still shoot out.\n\nIt must be charged before use. One gravship can support two gravship shield generators. -->
