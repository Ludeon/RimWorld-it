  <!-- EN: You must advance Anomaly research by studying unnatural entities.\n\nThere are two types of Anomaly research: BASIC and ADVANCED. Basic research projects progress when you study any entity; advanced projects only progress when you study advanced entities.\n\nYou can have a basic and an advanced project active at the same time. If no advanced project is active, advanced research will contribute to a basic project instead. -->

  <!-- EN: When an entity is downed but alive, you can CAPTURE it. To capture, select a colonist, right-click on the entity, and select 'Capture'. You'll need an empty holding platform or spot.\n\nOnce the entity has been brought to the holding platform, you can study it to gain Anomaly research.\n\nTend an injured entity's wounds to make sure it survives. -->
